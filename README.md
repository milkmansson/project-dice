# Project D.I.C.E.: A Toit Digital Dice project, showcasing MEMS capabilities
'Dynamic Inertial Computing of Entropy': Rolling up entropy of motion.

## History
A short while ago I began a project to create a digital random number
generator/dice loaded with a choice of 'bad' randomness and 'good'
randomness, with the purpose of illustrating (to customers) the impact
to a simple scenario such as a well-known physical board game.  This began
in Arduino - not being a professional developer, I eventually got stuck
in the complexities of managing multithreading/multitasking on the platform.
The project stalled.  Since discovering Toit, its virutal machines,
task/scheduling, etc, I realised I didn't have to solve those problems
myself, or rely on complex libraries I couldn't troubleshoot.  This is
a small Toit reincarnation of that project - with code and ideas robbed
from it, minus the entropy/cryptography lesson, plus a little polish -
in an attempt to turn this into a complete product simple enough for
kids to use.

## About this project
This is a digital dice, which uses motion data generated by moving it
to create randomness for a dice roll. I've attempted to push the
boundaries of what is possible - the intention is not to have **any**
other interfaces, eg, external buttons.  Any/all interactions (even
configuration choices) will be performed by only by movement.  (Features
have been used both to test and further refine development of this
[Toit MPU6050 driver/library](https://www.github.com/milkmansson/toit-mpu6050)
implementation.)

## How it works (State Machine)
| Stage | Interaction | Behind the scenes |
| - | - | - |
| 1 | Pick up the device to turn it 'On'. | Movement sense triggers interrupt waking ESP from deep sleep |
| 2 | Set it down so it learns which way is 'up' (the screen provides guidance). | Code examines movement and creates a calibration of 'up' |
| 3 | Tilt to select options like dice type (interactions onscreen), tap it against your hand to accept the choice. | Using calibration and tuned timing/wait states, save the options. Obtain initial selection from storage, and save selected options to storage for later use. |
| 4 | Set the device down for 15s to make the selection | Timer elapses, and selection (nim-roll/max-roll) selected |
| 5 | Shake the device, numbers adjust internally | Whilst waiting for the device to be set down, continutally consume data from the sensor, and roll together |
| 6 | When set down, display the 'roll' (plus distribution data, for interest) | Use a mathematical function to reduce collected data into a selection.  Display distribution data, and optionally save the distribution data to non volatile (flash) storage. |
| 7 | Wait.  Do another roll when moved (goto 5). | Use zero-motion-to-motion detection on the sensor to determine if shaking or resting |
| 8 | After 120s, go to deep sleep (off).  | Using monotonic time, wait for a (configurable) timer to expire and run the ESP32 command. |

## Worked examples/techniques in the source code
- Use of I2C throughout.
- Toit `pixel-display` driver and creating a display interface with both
  fixed and dynamic fields.
- Use of SSD1306 (via I2C).
- Use of MPU6050 (via I2C) and it's many features such as Motion Detection,
  and the use of the Gyroscope and Accelerometer.
- Task Scheduling on Toit.
- Interrupts via GPIO on ESP32/Toit.

## I want to build one!

### Parts Required/Prerequisites
This version was prototyped with parts on hand at the time.  Construction with
other hardware and drivers is totally possible, but may require some rework.
- **Toit** - The platform needs to be installed on your ESP32, follow the
  instructions found in Toit's [Getting Started](https://docs.toit.io/getstarted)
  guide.
- **ESP32** - I based this on the [DFRobot ESP32c6
  Beetle](https://wiki.dfrobot.com/SKU_DFR1117_Beetle_ESP32_C6) (v1.1) for the
  size constraints and (very) basic battery management built-in.)  Other Toit
  capable ESP32 modules will be compatible, however pin numbers may need to
  change.  See the guide below.
- **MPU6050** - I2C based motion sensing module.  (It could be argued that newer
  devices would be better choices, however this module is still cheaply
  available and good enough for this use case.  When I have other devices to
  hand, they can be incorporated!)
- **SSD1306** - Common and cheap I2C based OLED Screen.
- **LED** and resistor for indicating state (Optional).
- Connecting wires and other minor materials - if you are prototyping this, a
  good solderless breadboard, wires and other materials will be required.
- **Lipo battery** compatible with ESP32 board, and the expected device
  enclosure.  (Warning: polarity of the JST connector on commercial battery
  modules may not be the same as the JST connector on your ESP32 when
  they finally meet.)

### Toit Module Dependencies
After cloning the repository, a `jag install` executed in the project directory
should install everything required.  (Full credit to their original authors!)
Toit packages required:
- [font_x11_adobe](https://github.com/toitlang/pkg-font-x11-adobe)
- [pixel_display](https://github.com/toitware/toit-pixel-display)
- [ssd1306](https://github.com/toitware/toit-ssd1306)
- [pictogrammers_icons](https://github.com/toitware/toit-icons-pictogrammers)
- [mpu6050](https://github.com/milkmansson/toit-mpu6050)

### Steps
1. Wire the project together.
2. Clone this repository, and get into the directory.
3. Reconcile pin changes etc with the section at the beginning of
   `project-dice.toit`
4. Run `jag install`
5. Try it out by running `jag run .\project-dice.toit
6. When happy, install as a container, starting with [this
   guide](https://docs.toit.io/tutorials/containers)

### Wiring
Follow the wiring diagram here.  Deviations may need to be married up with the
pin definitions in the source code.

## Feature Implementation

#### This version
- Most features implemented.
- Menu selection incomplete, but underway.

#### To-Do list
- Provide better screen feedback about battery and charge.
- Provide a more interesting movement animation - perhaps a realtime plot/
  animation of force.
- Have generated data sent to an online destination, for better statistical
  analysis.  (Include integration with Toit BLE Wifi provisioning package.)
- Integrate an SRAM chip (like the 47L16) instead of flash for saving data, to
  help save flash lifetime when collecting roll distribution data, and the
  desire to save it every roll.
- Code integration with Artemis (use being optional) - for no other reason than
  to push myself and whats possible, including OTA firmware updates.
- Refine module selection - find a better ESP32 model with better battery
  management integrated.
- Experiment/integrate with other MEMS sensors, potentially implement AHRS, ftw.
  (If you are able to donate one, this would accelerate development!).

## About Toit
One would assume you are here because you know what Toit is.  If you dont:
> Toit is a high-level, memory-safe language, with container/VM technology built
> specifically for microcontrollers (not a desktop language port). It gives fast
> iteration (live reloads over Wi-Fi in seconds), robust serviceability, and
> performance thatâ€™s far closer to C than typical scripting options on the
> ESP32. [[link](https://toitlang.org/)]
